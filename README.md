# Friday Night Funkin' - Codename Engine (WIP)
Codename Engine is a new Friday Night Funkin' Engine aimed at simplifying modding, along with extensiblity and ease of use.<br>
Make sure to read the wiki and join the Discord server linked there!

- It includes many new features, as seen [here](other/FEATURES.md)<br>
- Wanna see the new features added in the most recent update? Click [here](other/PATCHNOTES.md)<br>
- Build instructions can be found [here](other/BUILDING.md).
	- Also, navigating to `shell-scripts\cne` and running the command `.\cne test` uses the source assets folder instead of the export one for easier development (Although you can still use `lime test windows` normally).

## PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS STILL IN A BETA STATE
### Mods created with beta versions of Codename may not be compatible with the release version
Known issues in the beta:
- Some options are missing

## How to download
Latest builds for the engine can be found in the [Actions](https://github.com/YoshiCrafter29/CodenameEngine/actions) tab.<br>
In the future (when the engine won't be a WIP anymore) we're gonna also publish the engine on platforms like Gamebanana; stay tuned!
